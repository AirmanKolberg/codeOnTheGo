Often times I'm writing some sort of Python program on one laptop or another, or perhaps even a desktop.
It seems very common to me that I'm writing for a couple of hours on one device, then having to shift to another.
To prevent complications, I've written a simple Bash script that I run at the end of each of my sessions to take the current
project directory, and copy it to an external USB stick in a simple and automated way.  I then saved the script in
/usr/local/bin on all of my machines (running Kali, my daily driver) so it can be ran from anywhere in the Terminal.

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!
